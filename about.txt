Scheduling simulation description:

    1) First Come, First Served:
        Processes executed by their arriving time.
    2) Shortest Job First:
        Processes executed by their burst time, starting with the shortest burst.
    3) Shortest Remaining Time First:
        Processes executed by burst time, starting with the shortest, however with pre-emption support (
        when a process with lower burst time is scheduled, if one with higher remaining time is scheduled,
        it's substituted).
    4) Round Robin:
        It's defined a quantum (a fixed time portion) and the processes will be executed partially in a 
        First In, First Out rotation until they're completely executed.
    5) Multilevel:
        More than one scheduling model combined.
